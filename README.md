## LINEAR REGRESSION TO PREDICT MPG

 - Vehicle Length and ground clearance were observed to have Pr(>|t|) values of very close to zero, making them the most likely to provide a non-random amount of variance to the MPG value
 
 - The slope is not zero due to the vehicle length and ground clearance having Pr(>|t|) values that are close to zero
 
 - This is a good model with a R-squared value greater than 0.7, showing a strong correlation
 
 ## SUMMARY STATISTICS ON SUSPENSION COILS
 
 - A variance of 62.3psi was observed, which falls under the maximum 100psi requirement.
 
 - Lots 1 and 2 fall within the 100psi requirement. Lot 3 at 170psi does NOT meet the requirement.
